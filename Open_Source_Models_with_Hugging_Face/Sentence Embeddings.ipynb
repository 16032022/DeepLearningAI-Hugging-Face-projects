    "## Introduction\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use the `sentence-transformers` library to generate sentence embeddings for various NLP tasks such as similarity measurement, clustering, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "If you would like to run this code on your own machine, you can install the following:\n",
    "``` \n",
    "    !pip install sentence-transformers\n",
    "```\n",
    "- The sentence-transformers library is particularly useful when working with tasks that require understanding or comparing the meaning of sentences or text. Here are some common scenarios where you can use this library:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Sentence Embeddings: The library can generate vector representations (embeddings) of sentences or paragraphs. This is useful for tasks like semantic search, clustering, or finding sentence similarities.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Example use case: Semantic Search: You can encode a query and a set of documents, then compare their embeddings to find the most relevant documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Text Similarity: You can compare the semantic similarity between two sentences or     \n",
    "    texts. This is useful for tasks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Duplicate detection: Find similar or duplicate sentences or paragraphs in datasets.\n",
    "    Question answering: Match user queries with the most relevant answers from a set of candidate answers.\n",
    "    Text Classification: You can use sentence embeddings as features for downstream machine learning models, including classification tasks like sentiment analysis or topic detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Paraphrase Detection: The library can be used to determine if two sentences are \n",
    "    paraphrases, i.e., they express the same meaning in different words.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Clustering: You can use embeddings to cluster similar sentences or documents. This  \n",
    "    is useful when grouping related content or discovering topics in large text corpora."
